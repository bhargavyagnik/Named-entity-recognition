# NER
 Named entity recognition using deep learning


Named-entity recognition (NER) (also known as (named) entity identification, entity chunking, and entity extraction) is a subtask of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entities mentioned in unstructured text into pre-defined categories such as person names, organizations, locations.

In detail, it’s a process where an algorithm takes a string of text (sentence or paragraph) as input and identifies relevant nouns (mainly people, places, and organizations…) that are mentioned in that string. NER has a wide variety of use cases in the business like, when you are writing an email and mention time or attaching a file, Gmail offers to set a calendar notification or remind you to attach the file in case you are sending the email without an attachment.
Other applications of NER include: extracting important named entities from legal, financial, and medical documents, classifying content for news providers, improving the search algorithms, and etc. For the rest of this article, we are going to have a short intro to basic terminology in NER and different approaches to tackle the NER problem, then we will jump into a detailed discussion of each use case.

Here LSTM model was used to train the model.
